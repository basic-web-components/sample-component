A sample web component created entirely from mixins from the
basic-component-mixins package in the Basic Web Components project.

The sample component uses mixins to handle common web component fundamentals:
* Creating a Shadow DOM subtree and stamping a template into it.
* Marshalling element attributes to properties.
* Efficiently referencing elements in its shadow subtree.

There are [ES5](Hello World \(ES5\)/) and [ES6](src/GreetElement.js)
versions of this sample component to show how the mixins work well in either
environment.

To install and run:

    > npm install
    > grunt build
