A sample web component created entirely from mixins from the
basic-component-mixins package in the Basic Web Components project.

The sample component uses mixins to handle common web component fundamentals:
* Creating a Shadow DOM subtree and stamping a template into it.
* Marshalling element attributes to properties.
* Efficiently referencing elements in its shadow subtree.

There are [ES5](Hello World\(ES5\)) and [ES6](src/GreetElement.js) versions of
this sample component to show how the mixins work well in either environment.
